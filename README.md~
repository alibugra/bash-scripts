which bash

- NOTE: Every bash shell script in this tutorial starts with shebang:"#!" which is not read as a comment. First line is also a place where you put your interpreter which is in this case: /bin/bash.

- Navigate to a directory where your "*.sh" is located and make the file executable:

chmod +x *.sh 

- Now you are ready to execute your bash script:

./*.sh
